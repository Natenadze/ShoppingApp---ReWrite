# Hi there

#### This project is a reimplementation of my final project from a Smart Academy course


## Significant improvements and new features.

Key Differences and Enhancements
1. Data Persistence: The original project used UserDefaults for data storage, while the new version incorporates CoreData, a more robust solution.

2. Architectural Design: In the reimagined project, I have implemented the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

3. User Interface: The UI has been transformed from a storyboard-based approach to programmatic UI development, offering greater flexibility and adaptability.

4. Testing: Unit tests and UI tests, ensuring code quality and reliability.
